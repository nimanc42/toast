üöÄ Replit AI Prompt for ‚ÄúA Toast to You‚Äù App

Objective:
Build a fully functional prototype of a motivational web app called ‚ÄúA Toast to You‚Äù, designed for daily positivity reflections and weekly AI-generated celebrations.

Core functionality (MVP Requirements):
	‚Ä¢	User Authentication:
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to securely sign-up and log in.
	‚Ä¢	Store user information safely using Replit‚Äôs built-in database.
	‚Ä¢	Daily Note Input:
	‚Ä¢	Create an intuitive interface where users can submit a short note each day, either as text or audio.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically timestamp and store each daily entry securely linked to the authenticated user.
	‚Ä¢	Weekly Compilation and Playback:
	‚Ä¢	At a user-selected weekly time, compile all notes submitted by the user during the past 7 days.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate an AI-generated voice service (e.g., Eleven Labs, or similar accessible via API) to narrate the compiled notes in a coherent, celebratory speech format.
	‚Ä¢	AI Voice Personalisation:
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to select their preferred AI voice from predefined options (celebrity-like, motivational coach, friendly conversational voice, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Suggest new AI-generated voices weekly based on the user‚Äôs past selections and app interaction (similar to Spotify‚Äôs recommendation model).
	‚Ä¢	Tone Selection:
	‚Ä¢	Enable users to optionally select or pre-define a tone for the weekly toast (e.g., uplifting, humorous, poetic).
	‚Ä¢	Alternatively, have the app automatically infer the most suitable tone from user notes.
	‚Ä¢	Privacy and Sharing Options:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the initial playback is private and securely available only to the user.
	‚Ä¢	Provide options for users to easily share the full toast or selected snippets via common platforms (social media, direct links, email).

Additional Technical Guidance:
	‚Ä¢	Clearly structure the database schema to handle:
	‚Ä¢	Users (authentication, preferences, voice selection).
	‚Ä¢	Daily notes (text/audio, timestamp).
	‚Ä¢	Toast sessions (weekly compilations, tone, sharing preferences).
	‚Ä¢	Include basic error-handling methods, such as:
	‚Ä¢	User-friendly notifications if daily notes fail to upload.
	‚Ä¢	Graceful fallbacks if AI voice generation encounters an issue.
	‚Ä¢	Create an engaging and intuitive user interface that:
	‚Ä¢	Simplifies daily note submission (1‚Äì2 clicks maximum from login).
	‚Ä¢	Makes the weekly playback feel celebratory (e.g., animated visuals, engaging typography).

Measurable Outcome (Definition of Done):
	‚Ä¢	A working prototype hosted on Replit.
	‚Ä¢	Functional daily entry system.
	‚Ä¢	Successful weekly playback using AI-generated audio.
	‚Ä¢	Clear and functional voice/tone selection interface.
	‚Ä¢	Secure authentication and private-first sharing options.
