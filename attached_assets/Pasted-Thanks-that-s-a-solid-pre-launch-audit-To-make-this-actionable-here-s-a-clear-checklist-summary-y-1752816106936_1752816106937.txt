Thanks, that’s a solid pre-launch audit. To make this actionable, here’s a clear checklist summary you can copy, track, and send back to your developer or use yourself. I’ve added a few clarifying notes and suggestions:

✅ Final Pre-Launch Checklist for “A Toast” App

🔧 1. Environment Variables

Make sure the following are set up in the production environment:
	•	DATABASE_URL – PostgreSQL
	•	SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY
	•	ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
	•	EMAIL_API_KEY (Resend or SendGrid)
	•	Any JWT secrets or session config required

📦 2. Database
	•	Run: npm run db:push to ensure all schema changes are applied
	•	Confirm new fields (like dailyReminderHour) exist in production database

🔐 3. Authentication
	•	Test sign up, login, and password recovery flows
	•	If using OAuth later (e.g. Google, Apple), test redirects
	•	Ensure privacy/anon promise holds — no personal data is visible in backend or logs

🛠️ 4. Testing Mode
	•	Confirm testingMode: false in server/config.ts

🌐 5. WebSockets
	•	Decide: Are WebSockets needed now? If not, clean up or comment out unused WebSocket code to reduce complexity.

🛑 6. Error Handling & Security
	•	Add a global error handler to catch and log backend crashes (in server/index.ts)
	•	Implement production security headers:
	•	Content-Security-Policy
	•	X-Frame-Options
	•	X-XSS-Protection
	•	Referrer-Policy
	•	Permissions-Policy

🚫 7. Rate Limiting
	•	Add middleware for API rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g. express-rate-limit or Supabase policies)

🧪 8. Toast & Reflection Logic
	•	Confirm daily/weekly toast generation triggers correctly
	•	Ensure max reflections per day/week limits are enforced
	•	Audio is not regenerated unnecessarily
	•	Reflections without “listen” request don’t trigger ElevenLabs

💌 9. Email Notifications
	•	Daily reminder + toast notification tested using:
	•	POST /api/admin/run-daily-reminders
	•	Emails include correct links and time zones
	•	Ensure unsubscribe / preferences are respected

📤 10. File Storage & Audio Access
	•	Confirm:
	•	Audio files are saved (not re-generated)
	•	Secure but accessible links (Supabase storage or expiring URLs)
	•	Users can play audio directly from weekly toast emails

📊 11. Health Check
	•	Add a simple endpoint like:

app.get("/health", (_, res) => res.send("ok"));

To allow uptime monitors like UptimeRobot or health ping on Replit.

🚀 12. Deployment
	•	Push to Replit deployment branch
	•	Confirm cron jobs run (hourly) in production
	•	Watch logs for errors on deployment
	•	Add final “About A Toast” tab with story
