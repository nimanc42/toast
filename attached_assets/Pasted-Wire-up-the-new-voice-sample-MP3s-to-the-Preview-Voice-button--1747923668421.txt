Wire up the new voice-sample MP3s to the Preview Voice button
============================================================

1.  File paths
    • All samples are now in  /public/voice-samples/ 
      (e.g. /voice-samples/David Antfield.mp3, Giovanni.mp3, Amelia.mp3, etc.)

2.  Front-end changes   (client/src/pages/weekly-toast-page.tsx)

    a)  Keep a single hidden <audio id="voicePreview" /> element near the bottom
        of the component (or in a common layout).

    b)  When the dropdown changes, store the selected voice’s “file key”.
        Example mapping (can be an object at top of file):
        ```ts
        const voiceSampleMap: Record<string,string> = {
          "David": "/voice-samples/David Antfield.mp3",
          "Giovanni": "/voice-samples/Giovanni.mp3",
          "Amelia": "/voice-samples/Amelia.mp3",
          "Maeve": "/voice-samples/Maeve.mp3",
          "Ranger": "/voice-samples/Ranger.mp3",
          "Grandpa": "/voice-samples/Grandpa.mp3",
        };
        ```

    c)  Preview button handler:
        ```ts
        const handlePreview = async () => {
          const src = voiceSampleMap[selectedVoice];
          if (!src) {
            toast.error(`Preview not available for "${selectedVoice}"`);
            return;
          }
          try {
            const audio = document.getElementById("voicePreview") as HTMLAudioElement;
            audio.pause();            // stop any current playback
            audio.src = src;
            await audio.play();
          } catch {
            toast.error(`Could not play sample for "${selectedVoice}" voice.`);
          }
        };
        ```

    d)  Disable the button while audio is loading/playing (optional):
        ```ts
        const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
        ...
        audio.onended = () => setIsPlaying(false);
        ...
        <Button onClick={handlePreview} disabled={isPlaying}>Preview Voice</Button>
        ```

3.  No backend call
    • Ensure the preview function **does not** hit any API or change user preferences.
      It should only play the static MP3.

4.  Test
    • Select each voice → click Preview Voice → correct sample plays without
      “Error playing sample” banner.

Let me know when this is in place or if any samples fail to load so we can fix the path.
