                Humans are brilliant, but let's be honest, we're naturally a bitâ€¦ negative.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                We tend to dwell on what went wrong, what we could have done better, and what's still left undone. That's not a flaw it's survival instinct. But in a world where the pace is fast and the criticism louder than kindness, sometimes we forget to build ourselves up.

                A Toast is a gentle daily ritual designed to help you reflect on what's good. Whether it's something small you did well, something kind someone said, or just a moment you want to remember it all adds up. At the end of the week, you'll get a personalised toast. A celebration of you, in your chosen voice.
